The Simple Hospital Management System Features and Benefits
A Simple C Program For Hospital Management System creates an external file to store the user’s data permanently. Talking about the features of this Hospital Management System In C, the user can perform the CRUD operations to it. Like, add patient details by entering his/her name, disease name, phone number, cabin number, etc. The user can also view all the available patient records. Such as details and search a patient by its name, age, disease, cabin number. Besides, the user can edit information as well as remove a patient’s whole date or only his/her name, phone number, disease name, cabin number.
The main goal of our project is to provide various types of facilities to store patient details, and to provide good service. 
•	It should fulfill almost all the process requirements for patients information.
•	It should increase the productivity of system by utilizing it to most to improve its features.
## Benefits
The Simple Hospital Management System provides wide range of benefit they are as follows:

# System Specifications
## Hardware Requirements:
 Processor : Intel Core i5 10th Gen
Processor Speed : 2.11 GHz
RAM : 8GB
Hard Disk : 1TB

## Software Requirements:
Operating System : Ubuntu 20.04
Front-End : Microsoft Visual Studio Code
Programming Language : C
Display
Resolution : 1920 X 1080

# Testing
Software testing is a critical element of software quality assurance and represents the ultimate review of specification, design and code generation. The increasing visibility of software as a system element and the attendant “cost” associated with a software failure are motivating force for well planned, through testing.

All the functions are tested against various test cases.

# SWOT ANALYSIS
 
# 4 W's and 1 H
## Who:
•	Product owner : Hospital
•	Developer : L&T Technology Services
•	Tester: S.Md.Feroz (298070)
•	Lead / Manager / Architects: S.Md.Feroz (298070) 
## What:
The Hospital management system can be used to book a OP for Doctor, view details of current Patients, search for the details of all Patients, edit their details and delete the details after Discharge. This system helps the management team and makes their job easier by helping in saving data in a computer rather than entering details manually in books which is a tedious task.
## When:
The deadline is 15th of July and the project was started on 4th of July. The duration of the project is of 2 weeks roughly.
## Where:
Application will be running on desktops in hospital of our Patients to store data locally on their systems.
## How:
The application is written in C and no extra dependencies are required on the clients' systems.
